# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       operatingSystem : 'ubuntu-latest'
#     mac:
#       operatingSystem : 'macos-latest'
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
    - job: BuildJob
      steps:
      - bash: echo "do the build"
- stage: Devdeploy
  jobs:
    - deployment: DevDeployJob
      environment: Dev
      strategy:
       runOnce:
         deploy:
           steps:
             - script: echo deploy to Dev
- stage: QAdeploy
  jobs:
    - deployment: QADeployJob
      environment: QA
      strategy:
